wrk-py-divtool
==============
This is a private project, reflecting my efforts to get my hands on Python.
It is a very specific project with no common use.

But feel free to comment if you find errors or bad style of coding or things like that,
I'm still learning and useful comments and suggestions are always welcome! :)

regards,
